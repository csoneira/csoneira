# To Do

## User
- Decide which research visits/experiments should stay public (Jyvaaskyla, Quironsalud PET, LIP, USC lab assistant).
- Provide evidence for the proton therapy PET measurements or confirm removal.
- Make the Drive files public ("anyone with the link") or upload the missing certificates locally.
- Confirm dates that came from metadata (RSEF Biennial certificate, Valencia proton-therapy workshop, LIP internship certificate).
- Tell me if you want new site pages (Talks, Service/Committees, Skills, Research Visits).

## Agent (Codex)
- Download the newly shared Drive certificates and rename to the YYYY-MM-DD scheme.
- Update `cv_documents/cv_list.md` and `cv_documents/document_index.md` with the new evidence.
- Expand `docs/cv.md` and site pages to include the new conferences, talks, and outreach items.
- Add new pages and update `mkdocs.yml` navigation if requested.
- Do a consistency pass across dates/titles between CV, site pages, and document index.
