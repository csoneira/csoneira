# About Me

I am a predoctoral researcher at the Complutense University of Madrid, specializing in **Nuclear and Particle Physics** with applications in medical imaging and cosmic-ray instrumentation.

My research interests include electronic instrumentation, Resistive Plate Chambers, scintillation detectors, and in-beam PET for proton therapy, bridging fundamental physics and clinical environments.
